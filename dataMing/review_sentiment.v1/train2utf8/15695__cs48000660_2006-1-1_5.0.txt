由于我平时公差有时也住该店，印象不错。但ctrip的价钱更好。
本次是私人度假经历非常好！由于我在特别需求上注明登记日是小孩的生日，Check-in有蛋糕送--Thanks for Ctrip's professional
Room/facility/reception and location is excellent as before.Only thing need improve is the bellboy at gate is a little lazy as he's not willing to call taxi for us.--most of SH hotel like this...
Anyway, it's one of the best price/performence choice in SH.
