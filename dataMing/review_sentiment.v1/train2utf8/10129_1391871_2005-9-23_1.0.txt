賓館不可靠, 我本來叫了前台在早上六時叫起床, 但到七時電話仍沒有响過, 急忙起床趕車並問他你們為何沒有叫起床, 他們說太忙, 忘記了. 叫起床是很重有的事情, 一間四星級的賓館, 居然這樣重要的事情也忘了, 試問客戶怎能在酒店內住得安心? 酒店答應了的事情做不好, 對自己的誠信度也有影响.
This is the worst 4-star hotel I had ever stayed at, I stayed in that hotel on 16 Sept evening, and told them to wake up up at 6am to catch up the transportation to Huangshan, however, the phone never range, I got up and immediately phoned them, asked them why they didnt wake us up, they said they were too busy so they forgot, how can a 4-star hotel be so unreliable like this?
