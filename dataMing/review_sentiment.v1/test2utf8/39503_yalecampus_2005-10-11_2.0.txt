Located in but hard to be found or take taxi from in the downtown area.
It is ok in hardward if the price can be deducted by 35% of the current rate. Internet service is free and broadband, which is the only reason I stay here..

Software is completely unreliable, you have to help yourself out by understanding you are mostly on your own with the hardware in your room.

Do not expect much of the offered breakfast.

该酒店的好处就是地点不错，就在人民广场新世界边上(但不太好找)。
好像是事业单位的招待所转制的酒店，酒店服务很不专业，早餐9：30说收就收，也不管人还在继续往里面进，眼睁睁看着一个老外很可怜的要了两片隔夜面包片出去了..
吃早餐的十几个人还没有服务员两个上海人拉家常的声音大。
煎鸡蛋倒是不错，都摞在一起在一个大盆里，想起了学校食堂或者外边农民工的快餐。
整个就是管理问题，酒店服务人员都愁眉苦脸的，好设施不会好好利用，基本上软件附加值很低。
